# Coherent_One_Shot
Codes used to study coherent one shot Hamiltonian simulation, as presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11327

* Conventional_Hamiltonian_Simulation_QSP_Phases.ipynb computes the QSP phases for conventnional QSP-based Hamiltonian simulation (i.e. cosine and sine) <br />
* Coherent_One_Shot_Hamiltonian_Simulation_QSP_Phases.ipynb computes the QSP phases for coherent one-shot QSP-based Hamiltonian simulation (i.e. the even extension of the complex exponential) <br />
* Sign_Function_QSP_Phases.ipynb computes the QSP phases for amplitude amplification (i.e. the sign function) <br />
* QSP-Spin.ipynb uses QSP techniques to simulate a spin system <br />
